# PePSA Demo App

This application is largely a copy of the solid-client-auth demo, which can be
found [here](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn-js/tree/main/packages/browser/examples/demoClientApp)

This version has been extended with a JSON viewer, that automatically pretty-prints
requested JSON resources.
